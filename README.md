# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using historical market data, trading volumes, and economic indicators with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model is implemented in Python and leverages data science and deep learning techniques to handle volatile, non-stationary financial data.

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-stationary nature of financial markets. This project collects historical stock data, preprocesses it, engineers features, and trains an LSTM model to forecast future stock prices. The workflow includes data visualization and model evaluation using standard regression metrics.

## Features

- Downloads historical stock data using Yahoo Finance.
- Uses closing price, trading volume, and moving average as features.
- Scales and prepares data for time-series forecasting.
- Builds and trains an LSTM neural network.
- Evaluates predictions with MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted stock prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository or copy the code into a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.**
2. **Run the notebook or script.**
   - The code downloads historical data for the ticker `AAPL` by default. You can change the `ticker` variable to any valid stock symbol.
3. **Inspect the output:**
   - The script will print evaluation metrics and display a plot comparing actual and predicted stock prices.

└── stock_price_prediction_lstm.py  # or .ipynb for notebook version
```

## Results

- The model outputs a plot of actual vs. predicted stock prices for the test period.
- Example metrics:
  - MAE: *e.g.,* 4.59
  - RMSE: *e.g.,* 6.33
  - R² Score: *e.g.,* 0.86

 

## Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Measures average magnitude of errors.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):** Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
